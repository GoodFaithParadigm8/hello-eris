# hello-eris

Quick Start demo applications using the `eris` blockchain tooling.

This repository contains example applications of varying complexity and kind to demonstrate the `eris` stack in action.

Examples are organized first by their kind (e.g., `apps/`, `benchmarks/`) and second by their name within any kind directory.

Each example directory should contain: 1) a brief `readme.md`, 2) a `Dockerfile`, and 3) a single `test.sh` that returns an exit code.
